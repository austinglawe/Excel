Players from Basketball Reference that have an * are in the hall of fame
I wanted to remove that and create a column for those that are in the hall of fame.
First the player's name is in column G
for example : 
Bill Russell*
Muggsy Bogues

I created a column H and a column I
column I is going to say "HOF" for those in the Hall of Fame, otherwise it will be blank
Column H is the name with the asterisk removed

in column H the formula is:
=IF(RIGHT(G2,1)="*",LEFT(G2,LEN(G2)-1),G2)

in column I the formula is:
=IF(RIGHT(G2,1="*","HOF","")
